/* The actual implementation of vector is separated into two classes: vector and vector_async.
 * For the purpose of flexibility they both share the same interface but the limitations have to be noted.
 *
 * vector (a high-level wrapper to provide user-space interface to compose async calls):
 *
 *    - cached size: unlike capacity, the size of the vector might be changed asynchroneously (invoke measure() to refresh cached value).
 *    - data-access: discouraged due to performance reasons but is possible if to invoke load() first.
 *
 * vector_async (is used for the actual data-access inside async calls):
 *
 *    - capacity: can't be changed in async mode (so methods changing the size will fail if it's reached).
 *    - please check the list of allowed calls in vector_async.h.
