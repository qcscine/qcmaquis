/*
 * Most of the time single-threaded MKL calls are sufficient - but in some cases
 * there could be not enough tasks to be executed and therefor one would benefit
 * from MKL's inner parallelisation. And while MKL_NUM_THREADS environment variable
 * controls the number of threads in ALL of the MKL calls - it would lead to resource
 * overloading (and hence performance degradation) when there is no need for task's
 * inner parallelism.
 *
 * mkl_parallel acts as a guard - if used, only the provided number of threads is
 * used inside MKL calls during its lifetime, single thread is used anywhere else.
 * Without an argument mkl_parallel will look for MKL_NUM_THREADS and will result
 * in no op if it's not present.
 *
 * Important: set AMBIENT_MKL_PARALLEL environment variable to enable this utility.
