Usage  : nvcc [options] <inputfile>

Options for specifying the compilation phase
============================================
More exactly, this option specifies up to which stage the input files must be 
compiled, according to the following compilation trajectories for different 
input file types:
        .c/.cc/.cpp/.cxx : preprocess, compile, link
        .i/.ii           : compile, link
        .cu              : preprocess, cuda frontend, ptxassemble,
                           merge with host C code, compile, link
        .gpu             : nvopencc compile into cubin
        .ptx             : ptxassemble into cubin.

--cuda  (-cuda)                           
        Compile all .cu input files to .cu.c output.

--cubin (-cubin)                          
        Compile all .cu/.ptx/.gpu input files to device- only .cubin files. 
        This step discards the host code for each .cu input file.

--ptx   (-ptx)                            
        Compile all .cu/.gpu input files to device- only .ptx files. This step 
        discards the host code for each of these input file.

--gpu   (-gpu)                            
        Compile all .cu input files to device- only .gpu files. This step 
        discards the host code for each .cu input file.

--preprocess                                (-E)                              
        Preprocess all .c/.cc/.cpp/.cxx/.cu input files.

--generate-dependencies                     (-M)                              
        Generate for the one .c/.cc/.cpp/.cxx/.cu input file (more than one 
        input file is not allowed in this mode) a dependency file that can be 
        included in a make file.

--compile                                   (-c)                              
        Compile each .c/.cc/.cpp/.cxx/.cu input file into an object file.

--link  (-link)                           
        This option specifies the default behavior: compile and link all inputs
        .

--lib   (-lib)                            
        Compile all inputs into object files (if necessary) and add the results 
        to the specified output library file.

--x     (-x)                              
        Explicitly specify the langugeE for the input files, rather than 
        letting the compiler choose a default based on the file name suffix.
        Allowed values for this option:  'c','c++','cu'.

--run   (-run)                            
        This option compiles and links all inputs into an executable, and 
        executes it. Or, when the input is a single executable, it is executed 
        without any compilation or linking. This step is intended for 
        developers who do not want to be bothered with setting the necessary 
        cuda dll search paths (these will be set temporarily by nvcc).


File and path specifications
============================

--output-file <file>                        (-o)                              
        Specify name and location of the output file. Only a single input file 
        is allowed when this option is present in nvcc non- linking/archiving 
        mode.

--pre-include <include-file>,...            (-include)                        
        Specify header files that must be preincluded during preprocessing.

--library <library>,...                     (-l)                              
        Specify libraries to be used in the linking stage. The libraries are 
        searched for on the library search paths that have been specified using 
        option '-L'.

--define-macro <macrodef>,...               (-D)                              
        Specify macro definitions to define for use during preprocessing or 
        compilation.

--undefine-macro <macrodef>,...             (-U)                              
        Specify macro definitions to undefine for use during preprocessing or 
        compilation.

--include-path <include-path>,...           (-I)                              
        Specify include search paths.

--system-include <include-path>,...         (-isystem)                        
        Specify system include search paths.

--library-path <library-path>,...           (-L)                              
        Specify library search paths.

--output-directory <directory>              (-odir)                           
        Specify the directory of the output file. This option is intended for 
        letting the dependency generation step (option 
        '--generate-dependencies') generate a rule that defines the target 
        object file in the proper directory.

--compiler-bindir <directory>               (-ccbin)                          
        Specify the directory in which the compiler executable (Microsoft 
        Visual Studion cl, or a gcc derivative) resides. By default, this 
        executable is expected in the current executable search path.

--cl-version <cl-version-number>            --cl-version <cl-version-number>  
        Specify the version of Microsoft Visual Studio Installation.
        Allowed values for this option:  2005,2008.
        Default value:  2005.

--use-local-env                             --use-local-env                   
        Specify whether the environment is already set up for the host compiler
        .


Options for specifying behaviour of compiler/linker
===================================================

--profile                                   (-pg)                             
        Instrument generated code/executable for use by gprof (Linux only).

--debug (-g)                              
        Generate debug information for host code.

--device-debug <level>                      (-G)                              
        Generate debug information for device code, plus also specify the 
        optimization level for the device code in order to control its 
        'debuggability.
        Allowed values for this option:  0,1,2,3.

--optimize <level>                          (-O)                              
        Specify optimization level for host code.

--shared(-shared)                         
        Generate a shared library during linking. Note: when other linker 
        options are required for controlling dll generation, use option 
        -Xlinker.

--machine <bits>                            (-m)                              
        Specify 32 vs 64 bit architecture.
        Allowed values for this option:  32,64.
        Default value:  32.


Options for passing specific phase options
==========================================
These allow for passing options directly to the intended compilation phase. 
Using these, users have the ability to pass options to the lower level 
compilation tools, without the need for nvcc to know about each and every such 
option.

--compiler-options <options>,...            (-Xcompiler)                      
        Specify options directly to the compiler/preprocessor.

--linker-options <options>,...              (-Xlinker)                        
        Specify options directly to the linker.

--opencc-options <options>,...              (-Xopencc)                        
        Specify options directly to nvopencc.

--cudafe-options <options>,...              (-Xcudafe)                        
        Specify options directly to cudafe.

--ptxas-options <options>,...               (-Xptxas)                         
        Specify options directly to the ptx optimizing assembler.


Miscellaneous options for guiding the compiler driver
=====================================================

--dont-use-profile                          (-noprof)                         
        Nvcc uses the nvcc.profiles file for compilation. When specyfing this 
        option, the profile file is not used.

--dryrun(-dryrun)                         
        Do not execute the compilation commands generated by nvcc. Instead, 
        list them.

--verbose                                   (-v)                              
        List the compilation commands generated by this compiler driver, but do 
        not suppress their execution.

--keep  (-keep)                           
        Keep all intermediate files that are generated during internal 
        compilation steps.

--keep-dir                                  (-keep-dir)                       
        Keep all intermediate files that are generated during internal 
        compilation steps in this directory.

--save-temps                                (-save-temps)                     
        This option is an alias of '--keep'.

--clean-targets                             (-clean)                          
        This option reverses the behaviour of nvcc. When specified, none of the 
        compilation phases will be executed. Instead, all of the non- temporary 
        files that nvcc would otherwise create will be deleted.

--run-args <arguments>,...                  (-run-args)                       
        Used in combination with option -R, to specify command line arguments 
        for the executable.

--input-drive-prefix <prefix>               (-idp)                            
        On Windows platforms, all command line arguments that refer to file 
        names must be converted to Windows native format before they are passed 
        to pure Windows executables. This option specifies how the 'current' 
        development environment represents absolute paths. Use '-idp /cygwin/' 
        for CygWin build environments, and '-idp /' for Mingw.

--dependency-drive-prefix <prefix>          (-ddp)                            
        On Windows platforms, when generating dependency files (option -M), all 
        file names must be converted to whatever the used instance of 'make' 
        will recognize. Some instances of 'make' have trouble with the colon in 
        absolute paths in native Windows format, which depends on the 
        environment in which this 'make' instance has been compiled. Use '-ddp 
        /cygwin/' for a CygWin make, and '-ddp /' for Mingw. Or leave these 
        file names in native Windows format by specifying nothing.

--drive-prefix <prefix>                     (-dp)                             
        Specifies <prefix> as both input-drive-prefix and 
        dependency-drive-prefix.

--no-align-double                           --no-align-double                 
        Specifies that -malign-double should not be passed as a compiler 
        argument on 32-bit platforms. WARNING: this makes the ABI incompatible 
        with the cuda's kernel ABI for certain 64-bit types.


Options for steering GPU code generation
========================================

--gpu-architecture <gpu architecture name>  (-arch)                           
        Specify the name of the class of nVidia GPU architectures for which the 
        cuda input files must be compiled.
        With the exception as described for the shorthand below, the 
        architecture specified with this option must be a virtual architecture 
        (such as compute_10), and it will be the assumed architecture during 
        the nvopencc compilation stage.
        This option will cause no code to be generated (that is the role of 
        nvcc option '--gpu-code', see below); rather, its purpose is to steer 
        the nvopencc stage, influencing the architecture of the generated ptx 
        intermediate.
        For convenience in case of simple nvcc compilations the following 
        shorthand is supported: if no value for option '--gpu-code' is 
        specified, then the value of this option defaults to the value of 
        '--gpu-architecture'. In this situation, as only exception to the 
        description above, the value specified for '--gpu-architecture' may be 
        a 'real' architecture (such as a sm_13), in which case nvcc uses the 
        closest virtual architecture as effective architecture value. For 
        example, 'nvcc -arch=sm_13' is equivalent to 'nvcc -arch=compute_13 
        -code=sm_13'.
        Allowed values for this option:  'compute_10','compute_11','compute_12',
        'compute_13','compute_20','sm_10','sm_11','sm_12','sm_13','sm_20',
        'sm_21'.

--gpu-code <gpu architecture name>,...      (-code)                           
        Specify the names of nVidia gpus to generate code for.
        Unless option -export-dir is specified (see below), nvcc will embed a 
        compiled code image in the resulting executable for each specified 
        'code' architecture. This code image will be a true binary load image 
        for each 'real' architecture (such as a sm_13), and ptx intermediate 
        code for each virtual architecture (such as compute_10). During 
        runtime, in case no better binary load image is found, and provided 
        that the ptx architecture is compatible with the 'current' GPU, such 
        embedded ptx code will be dynamically translated for this current GPU 
        by the cuda runtime system.
        Architectures specified for this option can be virtual as well as real, 
        but each of these 'code' architectures must be compatible with the 
        architecture specified with option '--gpu-architecture'.
        For instance, 'arch'=compute_13 is not compatible with 'code'=sm_10, 
        because the generated ptx code will assume the availability of 
        compute_13 features that are not present on sm_10.
        Allowed values for this option:  'compute_10','compute_11','compute_12',
        'compute_13','compute_20','sm_10','sm_11','sm_12','sm_13','sm_20',
        'sm_21'.

--generate-code                             (-gencode)                        
        This option provides a generalization of the '--gpu-architecture=<arch> 
        --gpu-code=code,...' option combination for specifying nvcc behavior 
        with respect to code generation. Where use of the previous options 
        generates different code for a fixed virtual architecture, option 
        '--generate-code' allows multiple nvopencc invocations, iterating over 
        different virtual architectures. In fact, 
                '--gpu-architecture=<arch> --gpu-code=<code>,...'
        is equivalent to
                '--generate-code arch=<arch>,code=<code>,...'.
        '--generate-code' options may be repeated for different virtual 
        architectures.
        Allowed keywords for this option:  'arch','code'.

--export-dir <file name>                    (-dir)                            
        Specify the name of a file to which all 'external' code images will be 
        copied, intended as a device code repository that can be inspected by 
        the cuda driver at application runtime when it occurs in the 
        appropriate device code search paths.
        This file can be either a directory, or a zip file. In either case, 
        this tool will maintain a directory structure in order to facilitate 
        code lookup by the cuda driver. When this option is not used, all 
        'external' images will be silently discarded. When a directory is 
        specified, but does not currently exist, then it will be created as a 
        common directory (not a zip file).

--extern-mode <mode>                        (-ext)                            
        Specify which of the listed images will be copied into the directory 
        specified with option 'export-dir'.
        If this option is not specified, the behavior is as follows: if option 
        'intern-mode' is specified then all listed images that are not defined 
        as intern will be considered extern. Otherwise, if neither of these 
        options are specified, then all listed images will be considered as 
        intern. Note that it is allowed to both embed code images and keep them 
        extern.
        Allowed values for this option:  'all','none','real','virtual'.

--intern-mode <mode>                        (-int)                            
        Specify which of the listed images will be copied into the embedded fat 
        binary structure (option 'embedded-fatbin').
        If this option is not specified, the behavior is as follows: if option 
        'extern-mode' is specified then all listed images that are not defined 
        as extern will be considered extern. Otherwise, if neither of these 
        options are specified, then all listed images will be considered as 
        intern. Note that it is allowed to both embed code images and keep them 
        extern.
        Allowed values for this option:  'all','none','real','virtual'.

--maxrregcount <N>                          (-maxrregcount)                   
        Specify the maximum amount of registers that GPU functions can use. 
        Until a function- specific limit, a higher value will generally 
        increase the performance of individual GPU threads that execute this 
        function. However, because thread registers are allocated from a global 
        register pool on each GPU, a higher value of this option will also 
        reduce the maximum thread block size, thereby reducing the amount of 
        thread parallelism. Hence, a good maxrregcount value is the result of a 
        trade-off.
        If this option is not specified, then no maximum is assumed. Otherwise 
        the specified value will be rounded to the next multiple of 4 registers 
        until the GPU specific maximum of 128 registers.

--ftz [true,false]                          (-ftz)                            
        When performing single-precision floating-point operations, flush 
        denormal values to zero or preserve denormal values. -use_fast_math 
        implies --ftz=true.
        Default value:  0.

--prec-div [true,false]                     (-prec-div)                       
        For single-precision floating-point division and reciprocals, use IEEE 
        round-to-nearest mode or use a faster approximation. -use_fast_math 
        implies --prec-div=false.
        Default value:  1.

--prec-sqrt [true,false]                    (-prec-sqrt)                      
        For single-precision floating-point square root, use IEEE 
        round-to-nearest mode or use a faster approximation. -use_fast_math 
        implies --prec-sqrt=false.
        Default value:  1.


Options for steering cuda compilation
=====================================

--use_fast_math                             (-use_fast_math)

--entries entry,...                         (-e)                              
        In case of compilation of ptx or gpu files to cubin: specify the global 
        entry functions for which code must be generated. By default, code will 
        be generated for all entry functions.
